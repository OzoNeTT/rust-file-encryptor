  <h3 align="center">Simple file encryptor written on Rust</h3>
</p>

## What is this?

File encryptor and decryptor based on ChaCha20 and Poly1305.
There is no need to specify options like **Decrypt** or **Encrypt**,
because they are determined automatically using **MAGIC** number.

Also there is no filename dependence, because the original filename
of encrypted binary is saved.


## Usage

```shell
USAGE:
    rust-file-encryptor [OPTIONS] <FILEPATH>

ARGS:
